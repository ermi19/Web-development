# Ermiyas Gera Fisha Portfolio Website

## Project Description

This is a personal portfolio website for Ermiyas Gera Fisha, a cybersecurity professional. The site showcases his skills, experience, services offered, and provides contact information. It is designed with a clean, modern, and responsive UI developed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and FontAwesome icons.

The purpose of this project is to create an elegant and professional online presence that highlights Ermiyas's expertise in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and threat hunting.

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple standalone HTML pages linked together via a consistent navigation menu:

- `index.html` — The homepage featuring an animated hero section, profile overview, and call-to-action buttons.
- `about.html` — A page describing Ermiyas's background, expertise, and mission.
- `services.html` — Outlines the cybersecurity services provided.
- `experience.html` — Details Ermiyas's professional work history.
- `contact.html` — Provides a contact form for visitors to reach out.

All pages share common components like a fixed responsive navigation bar, footer, and styling via:

- **Tailwind CSS** included via CDN: dynamically loads Tailwind utility classes.
- **FontAwesome icons** for scalable vector icons.
- **styles.css**: a local CSS file for custom styles and animations.
- **script.js**: a local JavaScript file handling the responsive mobile menu toggle.

## Installation & Usage

Since the project uses Tailwind's CDN, no build steps are required.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure `styles.css` and `script.js` are located alongside the HTML files.
3. Open any `.html` file in a modern web browser to view.
4. For live deployment, upload the files to any static web host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
